## Application Idea
As a student, I often have troubles setting goals and keeping track of my time to spend it efficiently on doing coursework, personal projects, or studying technical questions for jobs or internships. I believe that I am not alone in this situation, and for me sometimes a small push or a visual to do list is all I need to look for to meet these goals. 

UMass To-Do Organizer will allow students to track and list their daily, weekly, or monthly goals into a more interactive platform that engages with it's users by keeping tracks of how many goals have been completed daily in a row, which would help with retenation and maybe eventually form a natural habit. To-Do Organizer's main goal is to give students a better sense of schedule and potential workload spacing to help them form healthy habits and give them enough breathing room to properly space out their courseload to understand it properly if their schedule permits!
## Functionality
The To-Do Oragnizer will all users to set goals/tasks that they would like to do, keeping track of various parts of the task and estimated goal of time. Ideally the data of this web applications would be able to handle

Daily Goal Setter:
    Dates
    Times - Unix timestamps
    Ideal Location -  string, if on campus maybe have a dropdown list
    Task details - string
    Completion - Daily goals could range from true or false, or it would contribute to a portion of completion on a overall weekly or monthly task

Monthly/Weekly Goal Setter:
    Ideal completetion date 
    Task Details
    Maybe a drop down or list of daily goals that contribute to this weekly goal - Link the daily goal details.

Continuous Use Data:
    Form of daily checkin that helps retain application users that use the same computer- via local storage?

Other forms of data that will potentially be used:
